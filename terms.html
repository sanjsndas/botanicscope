    <p>Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace invalid provisions with valid ones that closely approximate the economic effect.</p>
    <p>This clause applies irrespective of jurisdiction or venue.</p>
    <p>Unenforceability of any provision shall not impair the enforceability of the remainder of these Terms.</p>
    <p>Should a court interpret any provision narrowly, the intent of the parties prevails.</p>
    <p>We aim for maximum validity and applicability across regions.</p>
    <p>Your acceptance includes agreement to this severability.</p>
    <p>This approach protects the interests of both parties and ensures continuity.</p>

    <h2 id="force-majeure-title">Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>BotaniScope will not be liable for failure to fulfill obligations due to causes beyond reasonable control ("force majeure").</p>
    <p>Such causes include natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, governmental actions, labor disputes, or internet outages.</p>
    <p>We will endeavor to resume performance as soon as practical after removal of force majeure causes.</p>
    <p>Force majeure does not excuse payment obligations incurred prior to the event.</p>
    <p>We notify affected parties promptly when force majeure occurs.</p>
    <p>Use of services during force majeure periods is at user's own risk.</p>
    <p>This clause protects both parties during extraordinary events.</p>
    <p>We recommend users maintain contingency plans for critical needs.</p>
    <p>Communication remains a priority despite service interruptions.</p>
    <p>Force majeure will be interpreted following applicable law.</p>
